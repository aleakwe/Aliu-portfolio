        <h1>CSS</h1>
       <h6>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. While HTML provides structure, CSS handles the styling, enabling developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.  CSS works by defining styles for HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. It separates the presentation layer from the structural markup, making websites easier to maintain and scale. CSS can be written inline within HTML, embedded in a style tag, or externally linked through a .css file. <br>Services that i can provide using CSS
